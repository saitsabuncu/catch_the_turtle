# Catch the Turtle 🐢

"Catch the Turtle" is a fun and interactive game created using Python's `turtle` module. The objective is simple: click on the moving turtle as many times as possible before the timer runs out!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. A turtle will move to random positions on the screen.
3. Click on the turtle to earn points.
4. You have **30 seconds** to score as high as you can!
5. The game ends when the timer reaches zero, and your final score will be displayed.

## 🐍 How It Works

The game uses the **turtle** module to create an interactive screen:
- The turtle randomly moves to different positions on the screen.
- The `onclick` event tracks when the turtle is clicked and updates the score.
- A timer is implemented using the `time` module to limit the gameplay to 30 seconds.
- At the end of the game, the final score is displayed.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:
1. Add levels: Turtle moves faster as the player scores higher.
2. Introduce obstacles or multiple turtles.
3. Play sounds when the turtle is clicked.
4. Save high scores to a file.
